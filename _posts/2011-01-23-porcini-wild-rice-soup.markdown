Porcinis are pretty crazy. They have quite an earthy flavor, and an almost overwhelming smell.

Their flavor was pretty lost in the soup, but the dish was still pretty good. I really liked the rice with mushrooms. The recipe was very easy. Once again though, it makes a huge amount and so I'll halve it in the future.
