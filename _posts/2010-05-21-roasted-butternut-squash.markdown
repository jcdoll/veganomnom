The only hard part about this recipe is chopping up a butternut squash into 3/4" chunks. Once you do that, you are basically done. I actually find it funny that this is a recipe at all. But I guess not everyone knows that you can put squash in the oven and out comes roasted squash.

I didn't actually like the added coriander because it gave the dish a funny texture. Ground coriander would have been better so that it was smooth. Anyway though, this is just squash. A perfectly good side dish that is easy to cook up and is filled with vitamin a!
