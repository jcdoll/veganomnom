Coconut milk makes everything a little more delicious.

This soup is very good. The corn and coconut work well together and are even able to hide some summer squash. (Always a good thing when you have tons of squash on hand)

The only thing I don't like about this is the pureed corn. I'm just not a big fan of the texture, and both fresh and frozen corn seem to result in the same stringy toughness. I'm thinking that maybe I just need a more powerful blender. I'm using an immersion blender and the result is lacking. (I also had this same problem with the [Jalapeno corn gravy]({% post_url 2010-04-14-jalapeno-corn-gravy %}))

I might try to make this again without pureeing the corn. Or maybe I'll process the corn separately and then strain it? We'll see how it goes.
