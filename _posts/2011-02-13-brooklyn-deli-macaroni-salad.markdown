This is basically macaroni smeared with veganaise. Hard not to like if you like mayo.

It wasn't very exciting though, nor did it have many vegetables in it, so Joey said it was just okay. It might be a nice side dish on a hot day. If that was the case though I would scale down this recipe a lot. One pound of macaroni is a lot of pasta.

Making the dish itself was pretty easy, not much to it.
