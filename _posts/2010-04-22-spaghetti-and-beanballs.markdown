Spaghetti and beanballs is a classic. I think this recipe is as easy as it gets once you have some beanballs - pretty much everyone can boil some pasta and throw marinara sauce on top. Beanballs take work, but like previously discussed, they are very worth it. I think in the future I will probably make double batches of them. The incremental work isn't that much more and they seem to last very well in the fridge.

I used my regular whole wheat pasta (the type that costco carries - best I've found) and homemade nutritional yeast cheese and it was great. Anyway, not too much more to say about spaghetti.
