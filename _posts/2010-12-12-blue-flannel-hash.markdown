This was fantastic. The potatoes and tempeh went very well together, especially with the saltiness of the soy sauce. (And the blue color is just fun.)

The recipe was easy, besides some chopping it didn't take much attention. I did have to lengthen the cooking time a lot though. I probably doubled the time on the stove so that the potatoes were completely cooked.
