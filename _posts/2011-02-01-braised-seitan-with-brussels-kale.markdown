This was a pretty easy recipe. Just a stir fry with a good mix of spices and veggies.

It wasn't my favorite, but that's mostly because I'm not a huge fan of brussel sprouts or kale. Joey liked it a lot - especially the sun dried tomatoes.

The spices on the seitan were fantastic. Even if I change up the vegetables a bit, I'll definitely reuse the basic concepts here.
