I did not have high hopes for this recipe. Caraway seeds, sauerkraut, combined with kasha?? Recipe for disaster - and that's exactly how it turned out.

The sauerkraut in the middle of the pie was just weird. I couldn't even eat the final thing because it smelled so bad to me (I have a real problem with vinegar). Joey ate it, but I don't think he really enjoyed that weird center.

On top of that the phyllo dough burnt only after a couple of minutes in the oven. I'm not sure what I did wrong there, but I lucked out because I was able to peel the burnt layers off. (If there was any chance I would make this again I might cover the whole thing in tinfoil or lower the temperature)

The kasha mixture itself wasn't too bad - so without the inner layer, the dish might have been edible. But it was still just strange. Too strange for me, I won't try to make this again.
