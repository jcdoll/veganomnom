This recipe puts the grocery store soy ice cream to shame. The cream of coconut milk adds just the right amount of luscious fattiness without overwhelming the vanilla flavor. And it has so few ingredients - just 5! Take that dairy ice cream!

I've made one other soy ice cream recipe before this and it turned out very icy - just like the store kinds. This version freezes very well. Eating some the next day, and the week after, it tasted just as good.

My favorite part about this recipe is that you can go from ingredients to dessert in about 45 minutes. Because you don't have to cook anything, your blended mixture can go right into the pre-frozen ice cream maker. I have a Donvier [manual ice cream maker](http://www.amazon.com/Donvier-1-Quart-Ice-Cream-Maker/dp/B00006484E/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&s=home-garden&qid=1275188406&sr=8-12) (which is probably one of the best purchases I've ever made). So the ingredients go in, the handle gets turned once a minute, and 20 minutes later you have ice cream!

Best. Food. Ever.
