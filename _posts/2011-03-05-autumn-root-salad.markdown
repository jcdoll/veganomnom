The dressing on this salad was really good. Figs in maple syrup, all cooked down into a warm sweet liquid is just a fantastic idea. The cooked potatoes were also tasty, and I ate a bunch of them with the dressing while everything was still warm.  

The beets though, those just aren't my favorite thing. And they took extra time to cook too. I did speed them up a bit by roasting them in slices rather than whole, which was a nice shortcut.

So the dressing portion of this recipe was great, but the salad itself wasn't anything special.
