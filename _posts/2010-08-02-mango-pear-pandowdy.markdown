Making crusts isn't very fun. But mashing crusts into a half baked pie might be worth the effort.

This turned out very well and the mango pear combo was surprisingly good. It isn't a pretty dish but the taste makes up for its lack of style.

My pie crust is always a little less tasty because of the whole wheat flour but it was less noticeable here than in most of the other pies.

Overall, I would definitely keep the fruit filling, and might go through the crust mashing effort again if I had white flour I needed to use up.
