Kinda watery. Tastes good (probably because I think all tomato things taste good) but it definitely doesn't have a saucy consistency. Usually when I make my own sauce I add some tomato paste in addition to the canned tomatoes and that helps thicken everything up. I think that would make this recipe work.

I actually made the mushroom variation, which just involves sauteing mushrooms before you stir the tomatoes and spices in. Pretty easy.
