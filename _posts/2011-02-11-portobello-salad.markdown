Overall, Joey loved this salad, but it needs a little modification to be perfect.

The first issue is just the mushrooms. They are kind of wasted in this recipe. Instead of making a nice juicy burger, they are just an accent piece. To me that's not worth the effort of making them. The mushrooms also make leftovers a little trickier, because they just aren't as good cold.

That said, the rest of the salad is great. It was a teeny heavy on the onions, so I'll prob halve them next time. But the dressing was good, and the chickpeas are a nice filling addition. Without the mushrooms this would be a very easy and quick recipe. I'll definitely make the base portion again.
