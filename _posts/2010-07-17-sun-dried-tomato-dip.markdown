The dip had a very nice color, but it was a little intensely flavored. I think cutting back on the amount of sun dried tomatoes or perhaps adding extra beans might hopefully mellow the dish out a bit.

This is another easy to make dip, although the amount was too large for my mini food processor, so I might cut it in half in the future. The only really annoying part was that I had leftover beans because the recipe doesn't use a full can.

Overall, this was good, but not great. With some tweaks though I think it could be a really nice match to the basil tapenade.
