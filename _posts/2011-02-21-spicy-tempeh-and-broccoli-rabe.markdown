The pasta was a little dry, but the tempeh was fantastic. In the future I might double the tempeh sauce and make sure the pasta gets thoroughly coated.

I used baby spinach instead of broccoli rabe because I was having trouble finding the latter. The spinach went very well with the pasta, and I probably could have added even more to the final dish.

I used rotelle ([wheel pasta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotelle)) like the recipe called for, but after making the dish, I think maybe the authors were confused. They mentioned the "spiral-shaped pasta" in the recipe description, and after doing a [google image search for rotelle](http://www.google.com/images?q=rotelle), it looked like a lot of people confuse rotelle with rotini ([spiral pasta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotini)). So I'll definitely go with the rotini in the future, I think it would be a much better fit.
