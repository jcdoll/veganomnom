The croutons were delicious. The roasted garlic gave them just a hint of garlicy flavor which was just perfect.

The dressing however, wasn't as good, although it was probably my fault. I didn't realize to the last minute that I didn't have any capers, so I substituted some olives instead. I think this resulted in a less salty dressing, which Joey thought was just alright. The other problem though was not my fault. The raw garlic really gave the sauce quite a kick, and was way too much. I might halve the garlic, or only use roasted, or something like that.

The overall combination resulted in a typical caesar salad - which is just kind of plain compared to all the rest of the recipes in this section.
