This bread has a very overwhelming taste. It seems salty, but it isn't really, I think it's just the weird flavor of the caraway seeds. Eating a slice straight up was painful, but slathering it with butter diluted the intensity just enough.

The texture was very nice for a non-rising bread, so I might try to make it again without adding any of the seeds. Definitely not making it again without modifications though.
