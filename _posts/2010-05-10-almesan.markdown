Eh. Tastes funny. And toasting sesame seeds for this recipe is a pain. I much prefer my own version of parmesan:

1 part almonds
2 parts nutritional yeast
dashes of garlic powder, onion powder, salt, italian herbs, whatever else you're in the mood for

Blend everything together using some sort of food processor and put on top of absolutely everything. Delicious.
