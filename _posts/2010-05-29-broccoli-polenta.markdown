Molding polenta and then re-cooking it seems odd to me. I guess I'm not one for presentation of food, it just has to taste good. And this recipe was a lot more work for just looks.

The broccoli in polenta flavor wasn't too bad, although I thought it tasted way too much like broccoli! I think if some cheesiness was added it would be much better.

So for me, I would nix the mold/chill/cook steps, add some nutritional yeast, and eat it at its mushy best.
