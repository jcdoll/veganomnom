So I gave up on waffles. They are too much of a pain and the waffle maker is now gone. Instead, we have chocolate chip brownie pancakes!

As pancakes, this recipe was good, but a little intense. The chocolatey flavor is just very rich, and it's hard to eat after awhile. We ended up having a lot of leftovers. (The recipe size is also a little ridiculous - I really should have cut it in half)

The dough isn't sweet either. I had to eat mine with maple syrup in order to soften the chocolate bite.

All in all, I think I prefer the blueberry corn pancakes to these... unless I really needed a chocolate fix.
