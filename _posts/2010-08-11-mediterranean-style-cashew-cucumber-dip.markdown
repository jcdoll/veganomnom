I thought this dish was pretty gross. (I'm not really a big fan of cucumber, so I wasn't really surprised.) Joey liked it though. The dip has a very light and refreshing taste, and is probably a good approximation of its yogurt counterpart.

The recipe calls for 1lb of seedless cucumber. This translates into about 1 large one, and mine wasn't seedless, but that didn't seem to really matter. The whole thing gets ground up in the end. Removing the water from the cucumber was slightly painful, but besides that this recipe is pretty easy.
