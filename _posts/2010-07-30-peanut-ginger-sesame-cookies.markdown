These cookies grow on you. The ginger is pretty overpowering at first but then you get used to it and feel like eating just one more cookie... followed by another...

I have to admit that the uncooked dough was also really good. The peanut butter is more concentrated and the ginger a little more subtle.

This was another easy cookie although I did get lazy and didn't roll all of the cookies in the sesame seeds and sugar. The toppings were nice, but not crucial, to the end result.

I could make this again, but I think my favorite part is just the peanut butter, and peanut butter cookies are pretty good by themselves.
