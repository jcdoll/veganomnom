I thought these cookies were going to be hard to make, but ended up being suprisingly easy. Unfortunately though, they didn't turn out very well.

This was another stiff dough recipe, but unlike the others these cookies didn't seem to cook in the oven. After the stated baking time they still tasted raw. So I threw some of them back in for longer but it didn't make too much of a difference. They just had a weird doughy taste.

The fig smushing was easy, and tasted good while warm, but after the cookies were in the fridge for a while the effect was kinda gross. Cooked, cold, smushed fig isn't something I enjoy.

The end result is kinda cute, but not something I'll make again.
