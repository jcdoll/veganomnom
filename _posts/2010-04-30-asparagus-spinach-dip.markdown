This dip is bright green, and I love it. Green foods are a work in progress for me. I don't eat salad, hate brussels sprouts, cabbage, broccoli, and so forth - but asparagus is really starting to grow on me. And the combo of asparagus, spinach, and cashews is really good. It ends up with this really thick and creamy texture. Perfect as a dip - and so healthy!

Making it couldn't have been easier. I threw the asparagus in the pot, did some dishes, cheated by adding frozen spinach, did more dishes, dumped in cashews and pureed! (and then did more dishes... there's been a lot of cooking going on lately)

We didn't have any crackers, so I spread it on toasted bread for dinner, and it was delicious. So good that I actually ate the rest of it for breakfast. This is definitely one of my new favorites.
