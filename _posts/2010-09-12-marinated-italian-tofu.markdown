I didn't really like this tofu, although it might have been my fault as I marinated it overnight (rather than an hour). In the end it tasted too vinegary, so maybe it just soaked up too much of the sauce. Joey thought it was fine, but I much preferred the flavor and texture of the broiled tofu.

Part of the texture difference might be because I didn't press my tofu enough. It seems a lot more necessary for these grilling based recipes. The slices seem to fall apart otherwise.

When I try the marinated asian tofu I'll be sure to follow the pressing and marinating steps to a tee to see if things work out better.
