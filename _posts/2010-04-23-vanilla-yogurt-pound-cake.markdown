If you can't tell, I love desserts. And this dessert is no exception. Joey and I ate the whole thing in one afternoon, to my stomach's dismay. It was so good though. Nice, sweet, dense, moist slices of cake.

I didn't do much of the fanciness that this recipe calls for. I don't have an electric mixer, so the cake wasn't perfectly smooth. I didn't use a metal pan, and I'm always too lazy to grease/flour before dumping the batter in. None of that mattered though. It was fantastic.
