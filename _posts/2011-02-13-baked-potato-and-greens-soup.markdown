This was good - although I did add a little nutritional yeast when I ate it for a cheesy potato flavor. I could have done with a little less kale, but it actually wasn't too bad.

The potato wedges were fun, and gave the soup some texture. I do wish they had been a little smaller though so that there were more deliciously fried portions.

Overall this wasn't a bad potato soup.
