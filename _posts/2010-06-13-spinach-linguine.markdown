This is a pretty basic pasta-with-pesto recipe dressed up a bit with some weird additions.

I loved the onions and the thorough mixing directions. But the artichoke hearts were strange - I just don't think their texture goes with the pasta. Some chickpeas would be better for adding variation. As I mentioned in the last post, I would also leave out the fresh cilantro, just because I can't handle it. Some dried cilantro, or just basil would make things better.

Overall, not bad, and with some modifications it could be excellent.
