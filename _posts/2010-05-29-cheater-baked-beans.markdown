This didn't seem like much of a cheating recipe! There was just as much cooking work as normal baked beans - you just don't actually have to cook the beans. So no soaking, and the bake time reduces from 3-4 hours to 1 hour. If you have good canned beans, than that seems worth it, but it still takes time.

(I almost wonder if you could cheat further by not actually baking the beans at all. Making the sauce on the stove and just stirring the beans in might work just fine... and that would really be cheating.)

We had ours with corn bread which was a very delicious combo. The sauce was spot on, just the right balance between sweet and tangy. I'll definitely make this again, probably with additional cheating.
