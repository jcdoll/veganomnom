Not a bad sandwich. Not exactly my cup of tea, but Joey liked it. I don't really enjoy pickles, or mayo, or coleslaw... so all that left for me was bread and tofu. Which was actually very filling!

There are a lot of recipes rolled into one here, which results in a fairly time consuming sandwich. The tofu of course takes some work, but this dish also uses a custom mayo, and homemade coleslaw. I think I would just use store bought veganaise if I wanted to cut down on some dishes in the future.

Overall, not bad.
