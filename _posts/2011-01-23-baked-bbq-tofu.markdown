This is an easy dish to like. BBQ slathered anything is usually petty good - and it was easy too.

This recipe does produce much softer tofu than the others. Because of the lower temperature and the sauce smothering it gets a little gushy. Joey preferred this, but I tend to go for the broiled chewier style.

I might cheat in the future and broil the tofu before cooking it in the sauce.
