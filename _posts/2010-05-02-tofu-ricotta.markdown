We made this as part of the [eggplant rollatini]({% post_url 2010-05-01-eggplant-rollatini %}) recipe. It isn't very exciting on its own, but it definitely looks and tastes like ricotta cheese. Using your hands to crumble the tofu magically creates just the right texture. Throw some spices in, and that's that.
