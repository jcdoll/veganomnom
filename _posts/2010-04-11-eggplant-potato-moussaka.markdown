So far these recipes have been fairly amazing. The moussaka is delicious. Layers of roasted vegetables sandwiched by tomato sauce and topped with cream sauce. Better than any lasagna I have ever had. And you can eat as much as you want - because it's just veggies!

The preparation is fairly lengthy. Cutting/salting/peeling/roasting the eggplants, zucchini and potatoes took us quite a while. We only have space in the oven for 2 pans, so after rotating everything in it had already been an hour. Then you also have to make the tomato sauce and the pine nut cream. But oh... that pine nut cream is worth it. After it came out of the oven it had the perfect texture. Slightly browned, blending perfectly with the other layers.

And those other layers were divine. The vegetable roasting turned everything perfectly soft, with the potatoes providing a very filling feeling. (I have to admit that I ate quite a few of the zucchini slices before everything was assembled.)

All in all I think this would be a perfect dish to serve for guests. It takes a lot of work, but the 9x13 pan could serve at least 8 people.
