This dish is definitely... carroty. Joey loved it, but then, he loves carrot juice, which is pretty strange. The curry spices were a nice touch but it could have used a little more liquid to make a creamier dip.

My little food processor wasn't up to the task here; I had to pull out my submersible blender to get the carrot chunks to the right consistency. I probably wouldn't bother with the food processor next time, as long as the carrots cook for long enough.
