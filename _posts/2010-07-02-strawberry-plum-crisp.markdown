This was made with plums from our own tree! Which actually made it fairly tart, our plums don't seem to be very sweet this year.

The recipe was a fairly straightforward crisp and was easy to make. The chopped strawberries and plums simply get an oat sugar topping and then bake in the oven for 45 minutes.

I think you can probably throw any kind of fruit into a crisp. I used nectarines a couple of days ago and they came out very well. I did simplify things though because I don't usually mix anything into the fruit. To me, easier is always better.
