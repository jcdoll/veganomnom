Joey loves these. I think they came out very well, and were easy enough to make, but I still prefer the classic chocolate chip. I will admit that they have the most perfect cookie texture I've ever seen.

My favorite part about this recipe is just that the dough wasn't excessively dry. Some of the cookie recipes are so hard to mix together, but this had the kind of texture I'm used to for non-vegan cookies.

The recipe seems to assume it's going to be dry though... because it calls for rolling the stiff dough into balls and flattening them with your hand. I didn't need to do that, nor mix anything with my hands. I like it better that way though!
