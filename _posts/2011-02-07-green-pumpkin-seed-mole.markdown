Joey rated this a 4, but I thought it was just eh.

I mean, it wasn't too bad, but just had kind of a weird flavor - a little bitter maybe.  I think the pumpkin seeds were the main culprit. The plain seeds have a pretty bitter taste, and I think that comes through. It did end up very creamy, Joey even thought there was avocado in it. So the texture was good.

Overall, I think I preferred the normal [salsa verde]({% post_url 2010-04-10-salsa-verde %}) recipe (which would be much easier with canned tomatillos).
