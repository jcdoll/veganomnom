Easiness: 4
Tastiness: 1

I'm not a big fan of cold soups, and this soup definitely didn't do it for me.

The raw onion flavor was overpowering, and the poor beets were lost. Basically the soup was all gazpacho with maybe a teeny bit of borscht.

The soup wasn't hard to make, but if I really wanted a gazpacho tasting soup I wouldn't go through the effort of shredding and cooking the beets. (Although it does give it a pretty color)
