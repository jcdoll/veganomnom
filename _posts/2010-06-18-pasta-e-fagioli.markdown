This was a fine recipe - nothing to write home about. The gist is pasta, tomato sauce, and beans. A delicious combo but not extraordinary. Which is why it's almost funny that I didn't like the recipe. The tomato sauces in Veganomicon are just always too watery, and this was no exception.

So make your own favorite tomato sauce, choose your favorite beans and your favorite pasta and it will be a winner.
