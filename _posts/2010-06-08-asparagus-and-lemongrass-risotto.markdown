The lemongrass in this recipe was not worth it. I couldn't taste it at all, and I think this recipe would have worked equally well with just some plain old vegetable broth.

It was delicious though. I loved the asparagus and rice combo but in the future I will definitely cut out a bunch of the work here. Forget the risotto, cook the rice normally with veggie broth, sautee the vegetables in a separate pan and then mix everything together. That will be much easier and just as good.
