These roasted potatoes did not come out well. In fact, they were pretty gross. The potatoes seemed undercooked on the insides, although brown on the edges. The end result was oily and too firm.

I definitely prefer the [home fries]({% post_url 2010-09-10-diner-home-fries %}), [herb scalloped potatoes]({% post_url 2010-05-05-herb-scalloped-potatoes %}), or even just normal baked french fries.
