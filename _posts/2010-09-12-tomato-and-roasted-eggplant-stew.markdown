I halved this recipe which made the dish much easier to cook, but in the end I wish I had made more. I was pleasantly surprised by the eggplant taste in this recipe. It turned out very well especially when combined with tomatoes from my backyard (instead of bland canned ones).

I only needed to use one baking sheet, so the roasting wasn't too onerous. But I was puzzled by the description of how to roast garlic. I usually chop the ends of the cloves off before putting the bulb in the oven. This recipe didn't call for that, and then I couldn't get the roasted garlic out of its shells. I don't think I'll follow that set of instructions again.

Anyway, this is an excellent stew. One worth making repeatedly.
