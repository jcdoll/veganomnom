Easiness: 2
Tastiness: 4

I hate making waffles. I love eating them, but they always fall apart in the waffle maker and cleanup is a huge pain. So these get a low easiness score just because waffles are not something I will be making again. They would probably make pretty tasty pancakes though (not that I'm any better at making those - but Joey is!)

My favorite part of these waffles is their smell. Like baking banana bread. If you want to be really full (because this makes a ton of waffles) then this is a good way to start the morning.
