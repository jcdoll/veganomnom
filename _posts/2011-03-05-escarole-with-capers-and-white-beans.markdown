Salty!

I didn't actually have any escarole here, so I substituted in some spinach (once again!) Spinach is just my main leafy green standby.

This dish was very easy to make, but the caper brine made it really salty. That was pretty much the only flavor I could taste. I mixed my portion with some nutritional yeast, which made everything a little bit better, but this still wasn't a dish I liked.
