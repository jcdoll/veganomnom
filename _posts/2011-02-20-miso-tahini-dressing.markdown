This is definitely the worst dressing recipe. The whole thing was one salty, bitter mess. I mean, I guess that's what you expect when you mix miso and tahini, but still, it was a little intense. I know some people love plain tahini, but Joey and I just can not take that bitter edge. This dressing sat around in the fridge for a very long time.

Fortunately, I got the [Uncheese Cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1570671516) over Christmas, and so I knew just what to do with this horrible dressing. I turned it into cheese!

With a little nutritional yeast, onion powder, and other spices, the horrible way-too-thick dressing became an excellent cheesy spread. So thankfully, everything worked out in the end.
