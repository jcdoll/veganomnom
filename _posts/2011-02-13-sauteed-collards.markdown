Leaves suck. They just taste like leaves. Gross, green, chewy things. I don't think I'll ever be able to get over the hurdle of eating them straight up.

Anyway, this was an easy recipe that resulted in fairly salty collards. They weren't horrible, but Joey didn't really care for them either. We just won't be cooking these again.
