Maple candied pecans are fantastic. They were in some other dessert recipe a while back, but I had forgotten how easy they are to make. Just a quick roasting in a pan and some oil-maple coating and you get deliciousness.

The rest of the salad was very easy, just mixing the ingredients in a bowl. I did have to substitute the hard to find endives with some spring greens. (Which might have been a good thing, because they probably would have been too bitter).

The end result was a very simple salad with a nice, light flavor.
