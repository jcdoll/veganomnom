I wouldn't exactly call this a quiche, but it did taste good. The inside was just fairly squishy, more gooey then eggy. I did use a slightly smaller pan, so perhaps it just needed more baking time... but I don't think the combination of beans, asparagus, and nuts really has any chance of becoming firm. However, once you set aside your expectations, it really works, and I think the fresh tarragon is the key.

There were a lot of steps to this recipe, especially once you add in the crust making, so the whole thing took an exceedingly long time. I had a lazy afternoon though and this was a nice way to fill the time and end up with something delicious.
