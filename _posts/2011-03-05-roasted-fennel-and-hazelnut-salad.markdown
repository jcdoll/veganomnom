Joey says this was his favorite salad out of the whole set. He is a big fan of dried cranberries, but the shallot dressing really won him over. The roasted fennel was also pretty good, I even ate some of it.

Making the salad involved some roasting of veggies and a slightly more difficult dressing, but the overall effort was still fairly minimal. So this recipe was definitely a huge success.
