This soup is pretty delicious, but could use some modifications. I thought it was very heavy on noodles and didn't have enough broth or veggies. I also don't think the chickpeas fit very well. I love chickpeas, but I think they added a crunchiness that I'm not used to in my noodle soups. I guess I was just expecting something different.

With all of that, next time I'll probably omit the chickpeas, double (at least) the veggies, and half the noodles.

The basic broth of the recipe was very tasty. The miso added a nice flavor that wasn't too overwhelming or salty (I did add a little less than the recipe called for just because I usually find miso a little strong.)

Overall, great recipe. I'm definitely going to use this structure for my future veganized chicken noodle soups.
