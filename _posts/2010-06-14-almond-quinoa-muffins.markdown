These muffins are good, but they took a lot of work for the result. They are definitely healthy tasting, which I've been counteracting by spreading jam on them for breakfast.

The recipe itself has some issues though. The text portion calls for baking soda and powder, although the ingredient list only has the powder... so I replaced half of the powder measurement with baking soda to get both in there. I have noticed that this book has a lot of small errors. It isn't enough to make me not recommend it, because I love the recipes, but it can be annoying.

You are also supposed to let the soy milk and ground flax sit for a minute after being stirred and I just wish the authors would tell me why I'm supposed to do this. Just like soy milk curdling, which never seems to happen, I just want to be told why this extra bit of effort is worth it.
