Awesome, easy, and relatively healthy. I loved these muffins.

There isn't much else to say. The batter is about as easy as it gets - mix things in a bowl and pour it into muffin tins. (And ignore the curdling nonsense which never does anything)

The oat bran tasted good, although I have no idea how the taste compares to wheat bran or germ. I did like these better than the [Banana-wheat germ muffins]({% post_url 2010-05-23-banana-wheat-germ-muffins %}). Maybe I'll try substituting with one of the other bran/germ things in the future just to see what happens.
