This is a pretty easy stew once you do all of your chopping. It tasted pretty good too - not great, but a decent meal.

My least favorite part was the plantains. They ended up pretty starchy and detracted from the rest of the soup. I think they could have been better with some additional cooking time though. In the future I could see adding them at the same time as the onions and peppers, or I could chop them smaller... or just leave them out.

Overall, I might make this again with some modifications.
