It's hard not to like barbecue sauce - and this recipe was no exception. It turned out very well, with a nice fruity taste and a very smooth consistency.

I made this with canned apricots, because spring hasn't quite arrived yet. This definitely cut down on some of the prep time, but I can't wait to try this recipe again with fresh fruit.

The whole dish only took around 30min to make, and it's easy enough to whip up whenever barbecue sauce is needed. This is definitely a staple.
