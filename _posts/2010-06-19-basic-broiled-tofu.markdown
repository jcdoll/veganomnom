This tofu is so pretty. Nice firm shape and golden color. It doesn't taste like much, but tofu never does.

The recipe was fairly easy though involved. Deciphering the instructions for chopping the tofu took a while but after we (ie Joey) got it, broiling the tofu with sauce on top was straight forward.

Cooking it makes a huge mess though. The marinating sauce was thoroughly baked onto the pan - which made for a soaking and scrubbing nightmare. I'm crossing my fingers for another tofu cooking recipe which will be easier.
