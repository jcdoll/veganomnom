So at first I didn't think this sauce was very good. I didn't have a good use for it, so was just putting it on some bread and it was very heavy on the wine. The day after I made it though I saut√©ed some seitan with other veggies and decided to mix this sauce in. That turned out to be a fantastic idea and really redeemed this recipe for me.

Overall, this wasn't a bad recipe, but I think I still like mushroom based sauces more.
