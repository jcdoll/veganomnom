Not as good as seitan, but not as hard either - I actually like these a lot. The recipe is easy to follow, just mashing and kneading some ingredients and then frying it in a pan. Much easier than boiling the seitan for an hour.

We ate them hamburger style this time. Parts were a little chewy but the taste was excellent. We'll definitely make these again.
