This soup was delicious. It came together pretty easily and was very filling. It is essentially just lentils with veggies and tomatoes, but that simple combination definitely works.

The only issue I had was undercooked lentils - and that was my fault. I can still only find green lentils at the store, and they always seem to need more cooking time then all the other varieties.

Very good and very easy, this is a perfect winter day recipe.
