This crust isn't bad, but our vegan graham crackers kinda suck and screw it up. The only ones I can find are amaranth based, giving them a weird, not very sweet flavor. They aren't bad, but they just aren't very fitting for the crust. If I made it again, I'd probably compensate by adding more sugar.

I did like the texture, it went well with the pumpkin pie I cooked in it. I'll still probably stick with my oatmeal based version though.
