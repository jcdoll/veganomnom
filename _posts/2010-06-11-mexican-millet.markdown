Like spanish rice, but with a new texture, this was pretty good. Easy too. Just a simple vegetable saute followed by 30 min of cooking the millet. We ate this straight up and then had it later on inside of tortillas.

Millet took me a while to find (I eventually got it from the bulk bins in Whole Foods) but I really like it. It is nice to vary the grains that we eat so much of. Veganomicon has taken me from just wheat and rice to millet, polenta, couscous, quinoa, and many types of flours. It's nice to eat new things.
