Easiness: 4
Tastiness: 3

This dish turned out pretty bland. The mustard dressing probably should have been doubled or tripled to give the lentils more flavor.

It was fairly easy to make, but the crushed garlic fell apart when cooking the lentils, and so was tricky to pull out. If I tried this again, I would probably just include the spices and garlic in the final dish, rather than taking them out.

(Personally, I think lentils are better warm, so I don't think I would waste them on a salad again!)
