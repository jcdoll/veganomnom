I love onions. Onion soup, raw onions, caramelized onions, all kinds are delicious - and this recipe fit right in. It was sweet yet tangy. Caramelizing onions is pretty common, but I really like the maple syrup and onion combo, it definitely added a nice touch.

I'm not sure I would actually call it a sauce though, there wasn't much of a liquid component. The recipe recommends putting it on a veggie burger and that sounds like a fantastic idea. We just had them straight up, and on some bread. Both ways were very good. I don't think you can go wrong with this recipe.
