Easiness: 4
Tastiness: 3

This was a very simple salad once I finished shelling the edamame. The 3 ingredients, corn, edamame, and sesame seeds just get mixed together with a basic dressing.

Joey liked that fact that it wasn't leafy green based as a nice change of pace. I followed the tip to serve it in radicchio leaves though, and that was a horrible idea. The cup apparently tasted bitter and detracted from the rest of the salad. It was pretty, but I wouldn't recommend eating it.

Overall, this went over pretty well.
