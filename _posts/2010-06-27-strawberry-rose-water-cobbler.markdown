Rose water is strange. It tastes like concentrated roses, which is just something I'm not used to eating - especially not mixed with strawberries. It gave the cobbler a sickly sweet flavor and was very watery.

The lattice was fairly easy to make though. The dough was a little fragile but it ended up being a very pretty touch. I might use the concept in other recipes, but probably not for a simple cobbler.

I normally make strawberry cobbler by just tossing halved berries in a pan and topping with an oatmeal/margarine/brown sugar mix. It's easier and tastier that way, so overall, I don't think I'll go through the trouble of this recipe again.
