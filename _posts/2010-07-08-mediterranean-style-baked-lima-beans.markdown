I still don't understand what I'm supposed to do with the skins of beans. Both canned and dried end up having some skins which come off and others which stay on. The separated pieces look weird and I end up trying to pick them all out, which is kinda crazy, because it would be extremely tedious to get them all off.

Anyway, the beans usually turn out well regardless of the skins. And these lima beans were very good. They tasted like a spin on traditional baked beans but lighter and less sweet. They were were even better as leftovers inside a tortilla.

This dish takes a while to make, but it is a ton of food, so it's worth the effort.
