This was a fantastic recipe. The ingredients all went very well together and the sweet and savory contrasted nicely (although it leans to the sweet side). I especially liked the roasted pecans.

The whole dish was pretty easy to make, just a bunch of chopping followed by oven time. Perfect for winter, especially as a dessert.
