So Joey actually ate this whole recipe before I got to it - and I'm taking that as a really good sign. He says the dish tasted like salsa verde with beans, which definitely puts it right up his alley.

I steamed the potatoes in the microwave to make this a bit easier, and that got this recipe down to one real pot. It still had a lot of steps though, as well as ingredients, so it isn't something that's easy to make on the fly.

Because it was eaten so quickly though, I'll probably be making it again!
