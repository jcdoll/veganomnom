The butternut squash with mole turned out to be an excellent combination.

The method for cooking the squash in this recipe was a pain though. It calls for chopping the vegetable into 1 inch cubes, which is really hard to do through the thick and painful flesh of the squash. Usually I just throw mine in an oven for awhile and then everything gets much easier to work with. If I make this again, I would definitely change up the cooking method.

I didn't like the cooking of the summer squash either, I don't think it got tender enough during its 5 minute sautee. I think I would increase that time.

That said, the squashes with mole ended up tasting pretty good. I just need to make more mole.
