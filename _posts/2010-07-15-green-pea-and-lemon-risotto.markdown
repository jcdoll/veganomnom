Oh risotto, one of those things I love to eat but hate to make.

This recipe tasted fine. Nothing exceptional, but very edible. The only weird part here is the peppers. They aren't really part of the recipe at all, just a fancy garnish/side dish. Roasted red peppers are always delicious, so they definitely didn't detract from the risotto, but I think they might have been better chopped up and mixed into the rice.

This seemed a little more bland than the [asparagus risotto]({% post_url 2010-06-08-asparagus-and-lemongrass-risotto %}), but if someone else was doing the cooking, I would definitely have it again.
