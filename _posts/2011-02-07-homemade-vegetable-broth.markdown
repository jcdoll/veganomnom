Making homemade vegetable broth is simple - but it always feels so wasteful. I don't usually have a bunch of extra produce on hand. I try to use everything up in whatever dishes fit the bill. So taking a whole onion, several carrots, parsnips, or whatever else, and just using them up for some broth never feels right.

So this is easy, and it tastes just fine (no better or worse than store made), but it probably won't end up being made again.
