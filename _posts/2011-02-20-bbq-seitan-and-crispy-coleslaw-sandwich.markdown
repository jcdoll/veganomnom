This is another recipe that just can't really go wrong. I used freshly made barbecue sauce and freshly made seitan, to make these fairly simple and delicious sandwiches.

The only issue I had with this recipe was some unnecessary complexity. The seitan gets sautéed twice in this dish. Once to brown it, and another to cook it in the bbq sauce. The second sautéing made a mess, and didn't seem worth it to me.

In fact, I don't think I would cut the seitan cutlets up in the future either. Just browning the cutlet, then slatering in sauce and layering on the sandwich has nearly the same effect for much less effort.

Either way though, this sandwich was fantastic.
