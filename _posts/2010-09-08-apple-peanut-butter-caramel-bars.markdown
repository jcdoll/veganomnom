Like an apple pie in bar form, this dessert was very tasty. The peanut butter caramel was fantastic - combining maple syrup with peanut butter is something I've never thought of, but it turns out very well.

The only problem with this recipe is that it has so many steps. Next time I might cut out the crumb topping and instead double the caramel, just to cut out a layer.

Besides my laziness, this is definitely a keeper. I just need to get more apples.
