This wasn't actually that bad, and I'm not a big fan of leafy greens. The tomatoes and onions went pretty well with the spinach, breaking up that horrible warm gushy green nonsense with a little bit of flavor. I might even double - or triple - the number of tomatoes to make this even more palatable next time.

I made the Italian version by using pine nuts and olive oil instead of ginger and peanut oil, just because I rarely have ginger but the pine nuts are always in the freezer. The Asian version would definitely give this an entirely different flavor.

Either way, this recipe is very easy, especially if you use pre-washed baby spinach.
