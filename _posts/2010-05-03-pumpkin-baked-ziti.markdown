This dish wasn't too bad, but it was a little bland. The breadcrumbs on top were delicious, and the caramelized onions went well with the pasta. It even had a perfect creamy texture; probably just needed a little more salt. That last part could possibly be blamed on all the wine we were drinking...

Even with the wine, it was fairly easy to make. Lots of steps, but everything was simple. The final dish actually looks a lot like macaroni and cheese. You can't taste the pumpkin flavor that much. That probably disappointed me the most, I love pumpkin.

Anyway, I'd probably make it again with some more spices, and maybe next time I'll substitute some of the ricotta with more pumpkin.
