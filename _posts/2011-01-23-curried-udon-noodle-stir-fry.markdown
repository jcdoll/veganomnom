Joey loved this (probably because he goes crazy for broccoli). I wasn't quite as sold, but thought it was pretty good.

I used pre-made seitan, so this was an easy dish. As written it does call for several pots though, which I just hate. When I'm making it my way I'll definitely reuse one pot to make the whole thing. (Cook pasta, drain, make roux, add veggies directly, saut√©, then add broth and noodles back in - worked for the gumbo recipe so that should work here too)

Next time it could also use some additional curry powder or a teeny salt.
