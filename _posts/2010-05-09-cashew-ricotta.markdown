Easiness: 4
Tastiness: 5

This turned out much smoother than the plain [tofu ricotta]({% post_url 2010-05-02-tofu-ricotta %}), and I think I liked the taste of it a little more. The smoothness is because you have to blend everything in a food processor. I use my little [mini chopper](http://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-DLC-2ABC-Processor-Brushed-Chrome/dp/B0000645YM/). Small but effective.

Mostly I am just impressed by how much this tastes like actual ricotta cheese. It's hard to get that sharp cheese flavor with substitutes, but the mild cheeses - ricotta, mozarella, even cheesecake - those are a piece of cake to replicate.
