This recipe went better than the regular potato latkes, but the overall result was still the same - a bunch of greasy fried bundles that I couldn't eat more than one of. They just made me feel gross.

Anyway, I learned some tricks from last time and made smaller bundles of dough for frying, and shredded the vegetables a little more finely. This helped the batter stick together a little better and made the cooking process much easier. I also used a lot more oil in my pan, and that helped too.

So I guess I can now make latkes if I want to, but they just aren't the right food for me. Baked fries and roasted veggies are much better!
