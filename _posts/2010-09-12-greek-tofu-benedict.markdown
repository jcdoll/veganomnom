This dish took a lot of work. It required 3 other recipes in addition to making roasted peppers. The dill tahini sauce was gross, and I wasn't a big fan of this tofu. But the peppers and home fries were good (even though I screwed these fries up a teeny).

All together it wasn't too bad, but I preferred the cheesy sauce and tofu used in [tofu florentine]({% post_url 2010-06-20-tofu-florentine %}). But then again, once you swap out those two ingredients, you are basically just making the other dish. So I don't think I'll make the benedict again.
