Joey liked this better than the [sour cilantro cream]({% post_url 2011-01-23-sour-cilantro-cream %}) but it still didn't get eaten much. It ended up having a little too much horseradish flavor, it was just too intense.

This was pretty easy to make, but I thought the oil cooking step was weird. Can you really taste the difference between grapeseed oil that has had garlic simmered in it, and oil that hasn't? I really don't think I can. Or, if I could, couldn't you just throw some garlic powder into the oil and call it a day?

Anyway, that whole process just seemed a little unnecessary to me. I probably won't make this again anyway, but if I did, I could see just leaving that step out.
