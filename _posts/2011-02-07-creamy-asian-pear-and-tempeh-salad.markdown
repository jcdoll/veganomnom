Joey loved this - and I even thought it was good too (while it was still hot and didn't have any dressing on it!) The combination of tempeh, pears, and peas was quite perfect. Especially with a little salty soy sauce. I ended up using some wild rice tempeh from the store, and that also added a nice touch.

This recipe ended up being pretty easy, because I steamed everything in the microwave. The chopped tempeh and peas just went in for 7ish minutes in a dish with some water. In that same dish I followed the rest of the recipe and then put a lid on and threw it in the fridge. It was very nicely self contained, and really easy to make for a lunch on the go. I'll definitely make this again.
