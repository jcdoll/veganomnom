So this isn't really a recipe, but I didn't realize that when I counted everything up in Veganomicon. Turns out it is just an additional header for the real sweet squash in mole sauce, and seitan in mole sauce recipes.

Anyway, I improvised. I used green beans and summer squash, sauteed them up and then simmered in the mole sauce. Served with rice it wasn't too bad. And for leftovers, we tucked the filling into tortillas.

The whole thing was alright, and if I had mole to use up I might do something similar in the future.
