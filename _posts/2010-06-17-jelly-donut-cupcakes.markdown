Joey has officially ruined this recipe for me. We couldn't figure out what the cupcakes reminded us of and then he finally got it - corndog dough - which is just so wrong in so many ways.

So these cupcakes aren't exactly bad, but they are kinda strange. The jelly does indeed sink to the middle of the dough without any effort, but because I made mini-cupcakes, mine had jam holes in the top. My cupcakes also wouldn't come out of the pan in one piece. The tops continually broke off the bottoms because the jam in the center makes them so much more fragile. It probably isn't an issue with bigger cupcakes.

The salty, preservative-filled, corndog taste is spot on though, and that's the real issue. These cupcakes just aren't right.
