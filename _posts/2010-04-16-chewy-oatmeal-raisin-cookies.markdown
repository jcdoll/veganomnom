Mixing these cookies was a pain. The dough was very dry and the oatmeal and raisins were very hard to add in. I've noticed this same issue with other Veganomicon cookies but this was definitely worse than usual. This cookie also requires brown rice syrup which is an ingredient I don't usually have on hand.

Besides that though, the cookies turned out alright. They have a great texture, a nice crunchy outside with a tender center. And they don't taste bad. They are a little sweet though and I think they could use more raisins. All in all, not horrible, but it could be much better. I find that usually I can take non-vegan cookie recipes and just substitute in margarine and flax for excellent results, so I don't think I'll make this one again.
