This recipe is a huge pain, but it is very tasty. The dough is easy to make, but I'm not a big fan of the rolling and oiling process. I suppose it's something you'd get used to after a while - and then maybe it would take less concentration. For now though, I'm just wondering if it's really necessary. I might try to skip all of those tedious steps and go straight to the dough frying.

Anyway, the end result reminded me of naan. And the dipping sauce reminded me of potsticker sauce! (From our pre-veg college days) Joey and I ate all the bread in one sitting, so I'll definitely make this again... I just need to be in a non-lazy mood.
