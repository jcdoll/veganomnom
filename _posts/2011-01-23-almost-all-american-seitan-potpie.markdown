So after making the [cauliflower and mushroom potpie]({% post_url 2010-12-12-cauliflower-and-mushroom-potpie %}) I knew I should double the veggies here to make the dish more appealing to my tastes. That worked out really well and this had a much better crust to filling ratio.

That said, I liked the cauliflower insides better than this pie's (which is amazing because I really don't like cauliflower). I think the other recipe's milk based sauce is just what my brain thinks a potpie should taste like. The crust on this one was much better though. Nice and flaky, even though I used all whole wheat flour.

I think the pie I'll shoot for next will have the crust from this recipe, the sauce from the other one, and a combination of the vegetables in each. Sounds just right.
