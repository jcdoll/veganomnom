Mini muffins! Who doesn't like mini muffins? They are probably one of my favorite things to eat.

These muffins were definitely... healthy tasting. I guess that isn't so bad if that's what you are looking for. I have quite a sweet tooth though.

Oh, and I just don't get the whole curdling soy milk thing. My milk never seems to curdle. I don't think I ever got it to work with cow milk either. So these days I don't even bother, and just toss the vinegar in with everything else. It never seems to make a difference. Down with curdling!

_Note: I made these again but upped the sugar to 3/4 cup. That turned them into delicious, but fairly healthy, cupcakes._
