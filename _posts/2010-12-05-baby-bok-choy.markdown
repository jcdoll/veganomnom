This was good! And who knew? A leafy green I can handle eating. Sure the bok choy is slathered in soy sauce and shallots, but it's still green.

The recipe was pretty easy, just simple chopping and saut√©ing. The shallots were cooked separately from the bok choy, so if I was being really lazy I would prob just cook everything all at the same time. Other than that this dish is a winner.
