I saved a lot of time on this recipe by using pre-roasted pre-peeled chestnuts from Whole Foods. I wouldn't recommend buying them though, it just seems that chestnuts are very seasonal items. (Or I'm really bad at finding things in grocery stores.)

This recipe has a very mild flavor to it. Fresh parsley (as opposed to the dried parsley that I cheated with) would probably have helped give it more of a taste. Better chestnuts might help too.

Overall, if I was already roasting chestnuts then I could see myself setting some aside for use in this pate. Otherwise though, I probably wouldn't go through the trouble of making it again.
