I really liked the cooked beans in this recipe. It turned the normal canned beans into a slightly mushy wonderfulness.

The sauce that went on top was good, but very spicy. The onions helped to make the canned sauce go a bit further which mellowed things out a bit, but in the future I would probably need to dilute the spice even more.

Overall, not bad for the amount of effort.
