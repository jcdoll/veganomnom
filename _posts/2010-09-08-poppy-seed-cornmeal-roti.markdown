Eh. This dish was a lot of work, and definitely not worth the effort. I liked the [scallion flatbread]({% post_url 2010-08-12-scallion-flatbread %}) much better.

Generally, I don't like roti, so it might not be the fault of this recipe. It was pretty tough though and didn't have a very good flavor. It went alright with the [pumpkin saag]({% post_url 2010-09-08-pumpkin-saag %}), but I could have just toasted a slice of bread for a better result.

The whole rolling, oiling, and folding process was easier than the last flatbread - which comforts me a bit. Maybe in time making any of these breads will take less effort.
