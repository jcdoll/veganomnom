This isn't a bad recipe. Just a lot of chopping, and then everything stews in the pot for awhile.

I've never actually had cholent before, so I didn't feel too bad when I blatantly contradicted the instructions and used tvp granules instead of tvp chunks. (You'll notice I'm doing a lot of subbing with these last recipes because I just can't find anything! The authors must live near some really crazy grocery stores.) Anyway, I thought the granules tasted just fine, although the whole thing probably wasn't exactly what was intended.

The only thing I really didn't like was the caraway seeds. I just can't get used to that flavor.

So this wasn't a bad recipe, and without the caraway seeds I would probably like it even more.
