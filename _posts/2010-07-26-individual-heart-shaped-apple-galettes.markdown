Easiness: 3
Tastiness: 2

Don't make this. I only got one pretty heart out of the 6, it doesn't taste as good as it looks, and it's generally not worth the effort.

One problem I had was that my apples were way too big. Most of my slices didn't fit inside the heart shape, except for the littlest pieces. This was why I only got one good looking heart.

These also made a horrible mess on my baking sheet. The sugar mixture that goes on the top of the cakes got everywhere and ended up burning itself onto the sheet.

I would have preferred a higher topping to crust ratio as well. The crust seemed too thick and I couldn't get enough apple pieces to fit on top.

I mean, these aren't the worst thing in the world, but most of the dessert recipes are much much better.
