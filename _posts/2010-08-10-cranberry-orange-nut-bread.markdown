This is a great tasting bread, even when made with whole wheat flour. It is moist and nice to munch on.

The recipe is pretty easy. I love breads made from batter, because they always seem so much easier than those that need kneading.

I skipped the orange zest, because it's a pain, and I didn't miss it at all. I also used dried cranberries instead of fresh ones, which made the recipe easier and year-round. Overall, it's a winner.
