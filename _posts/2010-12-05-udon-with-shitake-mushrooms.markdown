This was bland. The miso broth came out very well but there just wasn't very much of it. Not enough to eat the noodles like a soup, and it wasn't thick enough for a more traditional pasta sauce. So the whole thing was just, eh.

If I tried this again, I would probably at least double the broth, maybe while even halving the amount of noodles. I would also add more mushrooms - but not kale - there was plenty of that!

Overall, it might be worth trying with modifications, but it would need a lot of experimentation.
