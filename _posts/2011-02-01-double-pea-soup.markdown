This was actually pretty good. I wasn't expecting much from a split pea soup, which usually seem rather boring, but I really liked the whole peas that were mixed in. It made the whole dish more interesting. The roasted red peppers were also a nice touch.

The recipe itself was pretty simple, and, as usual, made a ridiculously large amount. I even halved the soup - so next time I'll be sure to only make a quarter.
