A little too tangy. And the oven baking did not turn out well. The top was very hard and crispy while the bottom layer was a little gushy. This meant that all of the brownies fell apart. You wouldn't be able to serve this up really well. I'm not sure how to fix it, maybe a smaller pan with more flour in the batter?

The blueberries and jam gave the brownies an interesting flavor, which was a nice change, but something seemed a little off. I actually used marionberry jam which is possibly less sweet than blueberry (although very very good). So perhaps I'll add less jam if I make this again to cut down on the tanginess.
