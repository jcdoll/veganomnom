I find spaghetti squash a little weird. All the other winter squashes are so delicious... but this squash just has such a strange texture. It definitely isn't my favorite.

This particular squash preparation was better than all the others I've had, but it still didn't quite sell me.

On the other hand, the salsa (which is also actually in its [own recipe]({% post_url 2011-01-23-tropical-avocado-salsa-fresca %})) was fantastic. But I already knew I would love that part.

This recipe had several parts to it, but nothing was too complicated. I could maybe see myself making it again if I swapped out the spaghetti squash with an acorn or butternut.
