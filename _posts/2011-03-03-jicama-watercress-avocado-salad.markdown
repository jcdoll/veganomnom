This salad was alright. Joey really liked the jicama, but not the watercress (especially in unchopped stringy form). The avocado and peanuts were obviously good, but the whole thing just made a strange combination. Especially with the spicy vinaigrette.

Overall, this isn't a favorite, but it was a nice introduction to jicama.
