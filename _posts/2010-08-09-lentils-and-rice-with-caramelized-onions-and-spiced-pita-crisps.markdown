This was way too greasy and bland. The lentils and rice have a nice texture together, but the dish just needs something else, some sort of sauce or vegetables.

The greasiness came from the onions. Caramelizing them in the oven just didn't work very well. The oil didn't really burn off but the recipe calls for mixing everything leftover in the pan into the rice and lentils. This resulted in a bunch of oiliness.

The chips were a good addition to the dish, but weren't enough to save it.
