I missed cranberry season, so I decided to give this a shot with canned cranberry sauce. (I was hoping for whole canned cranberries but it turns out the store only has sauce). Amazingly enough, it still turned out pretty well.

The canned sauce is filled with horrible ingredients, so it's not something I would do again, but it sure was fast and easy.

I liked the resulting spiciness in this recipe, and the lime flavor was a nice touch, so I'll probably try to make it again with real berries once fall comes back.
