It's been almost 10 years since we started this cooking / photography project. Based on the emails and comments we've received, it's been a useful resource for dipping your toes into vegan cooking.

I just saw that a [10th anniversary edition](https://amzn.to/2GolNgx) of Veganomicon has been released with **photos**, recipe updates, and 25 new recipes.

I don't currently plan to add the new recipes to this blog or to update the page numbers, but you never know. I changed the "buy" link up above to point to the 10th anniversary edition despite the (probably) incorrect page numbers because it's the best edition to buy.

In other news, some blog maintenance has been going on over the last few days. Some photo links and features will be broken until I finish working out the kinks.
