This sauce has a crazy tangy taste. It has a lot of tahini in it which makes a very weird combination with the dates and orange juice. I wouldn't say it's bad exactly, but it just doesn't really go well with anything. Several weeks later, and this stuff is still in the fridge.

The recipe recommends putting in on bitter greens, but we don't really eat any of those. I might even call this more of a salad dressing, because that's the only way I could imagine using it.

Anyway, not too hard to make, but it's still not worth the effort.
