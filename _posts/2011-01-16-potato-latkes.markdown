Blech. I felt like I was oozing oil after these. They splattered the kitchen with oil, made things smell like oil, and tasted like oil.

In general I'm not big on fried foods, but these really didn't turn out well. They didn't cook thoroughly, and ended up very raw tasting, no matter how long I left them on the stove.

I must have been doing something wrong, but I'm not going to bother giving the recipe a second shot. I'll always prefer baking over frying. (And baked french fries trump these latkes any day.)
