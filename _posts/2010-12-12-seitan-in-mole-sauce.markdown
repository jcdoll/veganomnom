This dish tastes like mole sauce, with some chunks in it. It isn't bad, but it is a ton of work. You end up making 3 separate recipes, none of which are easy. (I think I might just be against mole sauce. I don't think it's worth the effort.)

So if you had leftover seitan and sauce, throwing them together makes a nice combination. Other than that I won't plan to make this again.
