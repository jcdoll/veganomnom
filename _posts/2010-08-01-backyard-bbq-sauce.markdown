This is a pretty easy recipe, especially because it uses canned tomatoes. The only painful part is letting it cook on the stove for an hour.

I was worried about the sauce making a mess because it was uncovered, but it didn't even bubble over too much until I pureed the sauce at the end. Once I did that the whole thing seemed to get too hot and it went a little crazy. So in the future I just need to take the pot completely off the heat before pureeing.

I subbed out the liquid smoke for smoked paprika again, and that still worked fine. I also opted for onion and garlic powder instead of chopping fresh veggies.

I'll definitely make this again if I need some barbecue sauce.
