This was sooo good. I think I'm in love with mangos. Both the [tropical avocado salsa fresca]({% post_url 2011-01-23-tropical-avocado-salsa-fresca %}) and this make me wish mangos were local. But alas, I do not live in a tropical zone, and probably never will. Pretty sure I won't be able to stop eating them regardless.

This recipe did take me longer than 5 minutes, but mostly because it took me a while to cut the mango into chunks. After about 4 minutes of cooking, the chutney was ready and delicious. I ate it warm. Yum.
