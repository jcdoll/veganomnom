I've actually made this recipe many times now, so it has become very easy. Once you have the non-standard ingredients - brown rice syrup, sesame oil, almond extract - it's as simple as chocolate chip. (To get almond meal, I just throw almonds in my food processor.)

These cookies turn out very firm and crunchy. The almond and sesame combo is strong, which makes them a nice variation from many standard cookies. I think they would be excellent in an ice cream sandwich, so I think I need to try that soon!
