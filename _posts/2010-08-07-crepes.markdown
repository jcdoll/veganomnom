This is the best crepe recipe I've ever made. It was so easy to cook and flip - I didn't even need Joey! The batter stuck together better than eggy crepes, and didn't make any holes or have any issues.

It also tasted delicious. It has that great eggy-like texture because of the chickpea flour and just the right flavor. I made the savory wheat version (I avoid buckwheat as much as possible) and I could easily see pairing it with sweet or non-sweet items.

Perfect recipe.
