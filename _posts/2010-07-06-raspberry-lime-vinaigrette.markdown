My first dressing recipe.

I don't like salad, and I abhor vinegar, so the salads and dressings are mostly going to be eaten by Joey. That said, this dressing wasn't that bad, because it doesn't actually have vinegar in it! It tastes mostly like raspberries, which seems good if that's what you are looking for.

It was a pain to make though because it requires pushing a bunch of raspberries through a sieve. It just isn't much fun. I'd definitely rather eat my berries, so I won't make this again unless I really need to.
