I've always thought stuffed mushrooms would be hard to make - but these were easy and so delicious! Roasted mushrooms have a wonderful texture and just the right flavor. I think roasting is my favorite mushroom cooking method.

The recipe calls for some weird ingredients because it was trying to use an asian theme. I'd probably scrap that in the future and revert to the usual italian. I think I'll try normal breadcrumbs instead of panko, and maybe a green pepper or two instead of the daikon. I'll also look for the littlest stuffing mushrooms I can find because I loved popping the whole thing into my mouth and eating it in one bite.

Stuffed mushrooms are my new favorite appetizer!
