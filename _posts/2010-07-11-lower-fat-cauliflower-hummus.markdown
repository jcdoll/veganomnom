This recipe is excellent. It tastes just like regular hummus, except it has a whole head of cauliflower in it - a fantastic way to get some of that horrible brassicaceae family in my diet.

It takes a little longer to make than normal hummus, but only because you have to slice and boil the cauliflower. After that the garbanzo beans and spice just go right into the pot and everything was easily pureed with my submersible blender.

Definitely worth making when I have the ingredients.

(Oh, and subbing the scallions with onion powder and the fresh parsley with dried worked just fine)
