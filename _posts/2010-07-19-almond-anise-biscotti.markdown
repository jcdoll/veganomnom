I don't usually like biscotti. The cookies are usually too hard and painful to eat. Making it from scratch though is a whole different story. Both of the biscotti recipes were fantastic and took a lot less work than I expected.

I made the two recipes at once which saved a lot of duplicate effort. They have almost exactly the same recipe except with different nuts, and the addition of cocoa powder in one.

The dough is straightforward - just like normal cookies. The only new thing really is the double baking. You form the dough into a rectangle, bake it, then cut it in slices and bake it again. This isn't too bad as long as you aren't in a hurry.

And the best part is that you can control the crunchiness.
Best biscotti ever.
