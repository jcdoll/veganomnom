This soup was okay. Definitely not stellar, but it's a nice basic recipe.

At first I was very excited for the sun dried tomatoes, thinking those would add a nice texture and flavor variation. But then the recipe calls for them to be pureed with the rest of the soup, which I thought was really strange. I don't think they blended very smoothly and their wonderful taste was lost. I guess I'm just not sure what they were for, I definitely wouldn't have pureed them.

Besides that, this recipe is pretty simple. Just tomatoes, spices, and potatoes to add the creaminess.

I don't think I'll make it again, but mostly just because I'm not a big fan of tomato soup these days.
