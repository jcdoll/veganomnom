So this wasn't actually made in a skillet, but you know, who's checking? Using a 9x13 pan instead made the end result a little thin, but it was very delicious. I made the basic corn bread version and it was extremely simple. It took maybe 5 minutes to mix and I just threw it in the oven with the baked beans that were in there. I'm definitely going to try the jalapeno onion variation next time.
