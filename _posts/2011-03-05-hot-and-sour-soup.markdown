This soup was definitely hot. The spicy liquid just seems to seep into every part of my tongue. I haven't been able to eat too much of it. The overall flavor is alright, just a very brothy soup, which isn't my favorite.

The wood ears were disgusting though. I've never used those mushrooms before, and they ended up with a horrible crunchy texture. I'm not sure if I did something wrong there, but other dried mushrooms I've used (like shitakes) have turned out much better.

I was pleasantly surprised by the napa cabbage. I thought I was going to hate it, but after some cooking the greens just shriveled up and got lost in the broth. So they didn't detract from the rest of the dish at all. That said, I don't think I'll make this one again.
