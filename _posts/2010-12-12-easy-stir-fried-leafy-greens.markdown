So I cheated here, and used green beans instead of leafy ones (the book said I could!)

This saut√© turned out alright, but it wasn't the best I've ever had. I usually just go with my favorite mixture of soy sauce and nutritional yeast. (So good!)

It was easy to make though, just a bunch of oils and spices thrown on the greens.
