This gravy was pretty bland but it had a fantastic texture. It was just the right balance of mushrooms and lovely salty liquidness. I think it could be a perfect recipe with the addition of more spices and salt.

It was very easy to make and came together pretty quickly after all the mushrooms were chopped. I will definitely make this one again with spice modifications.
