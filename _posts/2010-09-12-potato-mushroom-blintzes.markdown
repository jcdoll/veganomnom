These blintzes were cute little things, but ended up being kind of bland. We had to eat ours with ketchup. The filling definitely needs some additional flavor, maybe adding some tomatoes or roasted peppers would help.

I did learn as part of this recipe that chilling the crepe batter before cooking is very important. The longer it chills, the thicker it seems to get. And without that fridge time it gets holes very easily, and is pretty much unflippable.

Unfortunately for these blintzes, I don't really ever have leftover crepes. I tend to eat them all as quickly as possible and so I probably won't ever get to this dish again.
