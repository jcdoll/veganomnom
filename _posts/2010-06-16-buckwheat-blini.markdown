Yuck! Only Lola (the dog) liked these. Buckwheat flour makes this horrible tasting batter which I was hoping would be offset by the chickpea flour and just wasn't. The resulting pancakes were atrocious.

To make things worse, the batter is yeast based and has to sit for an hour before you can even start cooking. This wasn't a good way to start a Saturday morning. Joey and I both bailed and had cereal.

Definitely not making this one again.
