Thank goodness I cut this recipe in half, it would have never fit in my main soup pot. I halved everything except for the can of beans, where I just used the whole can anyway.

The dish turned out really well. I left the lid off for a bit to boil off some water, and that turned this from a so-so soup to a fantastic stew. The rice and beans went perfectly with the tomatoes, and I thought the recipe had a lot of flavor to it.

Next time I'll probably forgo the roasted garlic, just because I don't think it made much of a difference. Throwing in some minced cloves directly, or even using garlic powder, would be just fine.
