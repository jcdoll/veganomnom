We made a fantastic meal out of these. Recommended by the recipe itself, I served the croquettes with the white bean aioli alongside roasted asparagus and red peppers. It was one of the best meals I've had in a long time, with just the right balance of vegetables, grains, and beans. These don't hold up much on their own, because of their delicate flavor, so I'm glad we ate them along with everything else.

Making the croquettes takes two steps - cooking the millet and broccoli, and then frying the millet in tire shapes. The first half is easy, the second half... not so easy. We didn't quite get that crunchy outer texture that makes croquettes so delicious. I think we probably should have made them smaller and ball shaped so that every side could be cooked properly. (The tire shape stays in place in the pan, which makes it easy, but the sides don't get done.)

This was my first attempt though, so perhaps there are just some tricks I'm missing. It should be fun to try again.
