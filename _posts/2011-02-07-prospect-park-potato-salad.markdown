This is another recipe that just isn't for me - vinegar, veganaise, and coldness - bleh.

That said, it was a perfectly fine potato salad. Joey ate it all up (although I think anything with veganaise will get eaten in this household).

The recipe was straightforward and easy, no complications at all. So, I guess if I wanted to make a potato salad then I could use this... but who would ever want to do that?
