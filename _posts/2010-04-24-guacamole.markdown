This is a very basic recipe. Nothing fancy or special, just a mashed up avocado with onions and some lime juice. Can't really get any easier than this though - it probably only took me 5 minutes to make.

I used an avocado from our neighbor's tree which has the perfect hass type. Very delicious. We have a tree in our backyard too, but it only produces this very round, smooth fruit which never seems to ripen enough - so all of ours go to the squirrels.
