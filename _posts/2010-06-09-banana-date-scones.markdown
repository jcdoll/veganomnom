Scones are easy! And this is a great recipe - mash all of the ingredients together and then you just scoop the batter onto a pan. Less work than cookies.

We ate these warm, and then had them again in the morning with some earth balance margarine. I think they make an excellent breakfast alternative.

Now I just can't wait for cranberry season so that I can try the Pumpkin-Cranberry Scone recipe.
