I've never had a mushroom burger before and it seems I've been missing out. This was the most fantastic burger I've had in a long time.

The marinade turned out really well, and the best part about it was that the portobellos only had to soak for 20 minutes. Of course, the cooking time was long - 40 minutes - but it just _feels_ much better than something marinating for an hour. I never start dinner early enough and my marinating times always get cut short.

Anyway, this was perfect, and I'll be having a lot of roasted portobellos in my future.
