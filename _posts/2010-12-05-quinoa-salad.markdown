Joey really liked this salad. It has a nice mixture of ingredients and a fantastic set of colors.

The recipe makes a huge amount and takes almost no effort. The only cooking here was really making the quinoa, and then doing a bit of chopping. And It seems like a good base for endless variations.  

This is definitely something we'll keep around.
