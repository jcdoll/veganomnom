The piccata was good... but much too salty for my tastes. I did really like the vegetable combination though. The olives, green beans and mashed potatoes had just the right variation in texture and flavor.

I also liked the fried seitan, but I hate frying things in the house. It always makes a huge oily mess and smells for days. It was also really hard to keep the seitan warm while the rest of the recipe cooked.

Overall, I might make this again, but it would need some modifications. I'd skip the frying, would use a thickener instead of reducing the sauce, and might sautee the green beans with the sauce instead of using another pot.
