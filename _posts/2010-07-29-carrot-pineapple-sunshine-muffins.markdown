Easiness: 3
Tastiness: 3

I've made this recipe several times now, and generally I don't think it is as good as basic carrot cake. I don't like the tanginess that the yogurt gives, and it drives me crazy that this doesn't use a full can of crushed pineapple. (Which usually results in me just using the entire can anyway and making really gooey muffins.)

I also tend to throw in much more than the stated carrot amount. I usually get carrots in big bunches and need to use them up - and everyone needs more Vitamin A!

I used to think these were fantastic vegan muffins, but I've now been exposed to so much new cooking that they keep falling on my rating scale. I'm gonna see that as a good thing though, because I just keep eating better food!
