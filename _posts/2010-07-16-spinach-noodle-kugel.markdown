This is a fairly simple casserole which actually tastes pretty good. The whole thing is smothered in spinach, but the noodles help break things up so that it isn't too overwhelmingly green. Adding dill seems odd but it was actually a nice touch and gave the dish some flavor.

I never plan far enough in advance for defrosting, so I actually took my frozen spinach and cooked it on the stove before adding it to the noodles. I also threw in 5 ounces of fresh spinach because it needed to be used up.

My pasta is a little off though... the recipe calls for a flat pasta - ribbons, broken up lazagna noodles, etc. I didn't have any of those but figured I could just take my tube pasta and crush it. This is an amazingly bad idea. Pasta is very hard when dried, and it ended up going everywhere without breaking at all. I eventually gave up and just used the noodles as is, which probably tastes different but seems to work just fine.

I also subbed the veggie stock with water which ended up making the dish a little more bland, so I would probably try not to do that again. Blandness is easily cured with a little nutritional yeast cheese though!

All in all, not a bad dish.
