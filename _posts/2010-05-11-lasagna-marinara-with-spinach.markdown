What do [Marinara Sauce]({% post_url 2010-05-08-marinara-sauce %}), [Cashew Ricotta]({% post_url 2010-05-09-cashew-ricotta %}), and [Almesan]({% post_url 2010-05-10-almesan %}) have in common? Lasagna! 4 recipes rolled into one dish - that's a lot of work.

It was very delicious though. I used a combination of spinach and arugula and blended it with the ricotta before the layering process. That worked out really well, but the greens could have used more chopping. There were some long pieces which I thought was gross. Next time I'll definitely make sure to blend it together better.

The recipe wasn't that hard, but it did take a long time. Using some pre-made sauce and eliminating the Almesan would definitely speed things up, because then you would only have to make the ricotta. Lasagna tends to be time consuming, but for us it's usually worth the effort because it always seems to last for at least 3 meals.
