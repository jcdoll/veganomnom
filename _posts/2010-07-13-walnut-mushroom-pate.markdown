This pate wasn't very memorable. Although it is easy to make, it's fairly bland. I think it was probably best as leftovers in a tortilla with salsa and other strong flavors. I guess I prefer my mushrooms in a gravy-like sauce.

Overall, I think this pate is better than the chestnut-lentil recipe, but I still prefer most of the other spreads to this.
