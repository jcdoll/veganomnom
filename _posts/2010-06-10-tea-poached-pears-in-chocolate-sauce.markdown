I thought these pears had a great texture. The chocolate sauce was a little intense, so I'll probably add less chocolate next time. Or even just use the tea liquid, which I thought tasted delicious. Overall though, this was a pretty easy and tasty way to eat pears.

The only funny thing is the shape of the pears when they are done. In the future I'll probably cut the pears in slices so that they don't look so strange when stacked together.

The recipe also recommends eating everything at room temperature, but I think I would have preferred to eat them right after cooking. Nice, warm, pears.
