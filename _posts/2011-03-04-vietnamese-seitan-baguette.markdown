This sandwich was plain. It didn't really have enough to it - just some veganaise and seitan with a teeny bit of vegetables and a lot of bread. The other recipes in this section have been much better.

The dipping broth was also a strange concept. It just felt funny to eat the sandwich after dunking it in a salty lime flavored liquid. It didn't really work for me.

Once the seitan was made, this recipe was easy to put together, but I won't do so again.
