My favorite part of this dish was the candied pecans. Sweet and crunchy, I'm going to make them by themselves from now on. I can see it being a really good topping for pumpkin cake too.

The rest of the dish was only so-so. It took so much work - 5 layers! - and I just didn't appreciate the end result. The chocolate filling, the bulk of the pie, didn't taste good to me. I thought it should be sweeter, and less thick in relation to the other layers. The delicious pecans, peanut butter caramel, and chocolate sauce all get lost. So making all 5 parts just isn't worth it in the end.

Overall, I'm not going to make this again, but the various layers will be good to mix in with other recipes. The chocolate mousse could even be good on its own, with maybe just the peanut butter caramel.
