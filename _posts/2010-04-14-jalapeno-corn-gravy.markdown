This recipe was easy, but I don't think I'll make it again. The pureed consistency was strange, because the corn gives the end result this fibrous texture. And the flavor doesn't go with any dish that I can think of. Not quite thick enough to be a side for enchiladas. Not smooth enough to put on top of rice. Just sort of ho hum.

If I had to do it again I would probably add the corn in after pureeing the pepper and onion base. That would remove the strange texture problem and would give it more substance. Then it might make a good side dish.

However, Joey says that it's awesome on bread and that it gets more of a corn flavor after sitting in the fridge for a day.
