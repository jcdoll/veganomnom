This mole sauce was good. It smothers vegetables well with a choclatey tomatoey kind of taste.

The spice mixture was a bit of a pain to make. And this dish does take some time, so I'm not sure I'll be making this very often. The recipe does make 4 cups though which goes pretty far.

Overall, if I'm in the mood for mixing up my stir frys then I might try this again.
