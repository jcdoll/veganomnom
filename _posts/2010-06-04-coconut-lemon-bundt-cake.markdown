I'm not really partial to coconut, especially the shredded kind that gets tossed onto atrocious desserts. This, however, was very different. I was blown away by the pure deliciousness of it. It's very moist and perfectly sweet.

Making the cake was easy. I did skip the lemon zest, because that always seems like too much work. I also used a very large baking dish instead of a bundt pan - the cake is huge. It does take a full hour to cook, but it's very worth it.
