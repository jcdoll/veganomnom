This recipe was okay, but not amazing. The chocolate chips overwhelmed everything, so it was more like chocolate gooey bread. Mine was also too gushy, I definitely didn't use enough bread. You need almost an entire loaf! If I made it again I would cut down on all the liquids by half so that it would be easier to have enough bread on hand.

It was nice to use up my overripe bananas though. So if you have a stale loaf of bread and inedible bananas on hand this is definitely a good way to get rid of them.
