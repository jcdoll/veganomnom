This was pretty easy to make, but in the end the whole dish was just alright. I guess noodle broths just aren't really my thing.

I have really come to like udon noodles though. They cook quickly, and have a salty taste to them - which can really hit the spot sometimes. (Especially for a small bowl of mac and cheese.)

The kabocha squash was nice and easy to chop, and turned out pretty tender. Definitely better than cutting up a butternut squash. And there wasn't any peeling!

The carrots and leeks were pretty much unnoticeable, and the shitakes were really bland after the rehydrating process. So overall, the soup was just okay.
