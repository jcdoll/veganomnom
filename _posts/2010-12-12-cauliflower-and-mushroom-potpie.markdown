This was delicious. Even the crust came out well, and I never have much luck with that.

I loved the sauce. It went really well with the veggies and tastes exactly like pot pie should. Next time I would probably even double the filling so that the crust wasn't so dominating.

There was a lot of work involved here, but it was worth a homemade pot pie.

_Cooking note_: to save dishes, I made the veggies first, poured them into the baking dish, then reused that pot to make the sauce.
