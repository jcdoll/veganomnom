The hardest part of this recipe was slicing the potatoes. The small yukon gold ones are tricky! I actually cut my finger and Joey had to take over.

But they are so pretty in their pan. All lined up in neat rows. And after cooking, they tasted incredibly good. I really liked the nutritional yeast on top - adding just the right amount of cheesiness. The texture was just right, the overlapped parts were tender while the exposed pieces turned golden brown with a nice crunch.

Overall, I thought the spices and milk combination was perfect.
