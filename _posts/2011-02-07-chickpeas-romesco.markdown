This was delicious. The sauce went very well with the chickpeas and made a great dinner. Some spiciness gave it a nice kick, and the almonds and roasted red peppers made the tomato sauce less plain.

There were many steps in this recipe, so it ended up taking a lot of attention, but nothing was too complicated. I will definitely make this again.
