I've never had real aioli, probably because I hate mayonnaise, so I have no idea how this compares. We ended up deciding that it tastes like hummus, except more garlicky - a light spread that can add flavor to anything. It did go very well with the broccoli-millet croquettes.

Pretty easy to make as long as you have a food processor, everything just gets mashed together. Definitely a nice spread variation.
