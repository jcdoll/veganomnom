It's finally squash season!

The filling in this recipe was absolutely delicious. I started eating it straight out of the pan and almost couldn't bring myself to stuff it into the dough. Acorn squash and black beans is a fantastic combination. And the hint of lime and maple syrup just hits the spot.

The dough itself was alright, but not great. I used whole wheat flour like usual, so that detracted from the flaky light pastry feel that I'm sure it is supposed to have. But I also thought the ratio of dough to filling was too high. I think next time I'll just warm up some tortillas and eat the squash and beans burrito style. Yum.
