It's my birthday!
So I wrote an ode, because I can.

Ode to a cheesy sauce:

My cheesy sauce, oh how I do love thee.
Salty, buttery, not too sweet nor sour.
On pasta or bread you satisfy me.
Your texture, creamy with a hint of flour.
Your color, a fake looking bright yellow.
Your taste, not quite right, but just close enough.
Easy to make - I don't even need cheese!
Saving animals, you're a fine fellow.
Sometimes avoiding real cheese can be tough.
But cheesy sauce, you have power to please.

(_Recipe note:_ This actually isn't the best fake-cheese sauce I've ever had, but it satisfied my cravings well enough. I'm not sure how I would live without nutritional yeast.)
