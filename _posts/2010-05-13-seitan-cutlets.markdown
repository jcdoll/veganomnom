This oven baked seitan was definitely easier than the [boiled version]({% post_url 2010-04-14-simple-seitan %}). It didn't puff up as much though, so it seems like it made a denser, smaller seitan. I think I liked the other recipe just a bit better, so it might be worth its extra effort.

We combined ours with mustard sauce and polenta - an almost stereotypical american meal of meat and potatoes with gravy!
