I love tempeh. I know it's weird fermented soybean stuff, but it tastes really good. This stuff was pretty spicy thanks to the 1/4 cup of sriracha. We had ours with roasted asparagus and pasta. I  spooned extra marinade over the noodles for a sauce and the whole thing was fantastic.

I'm always so proud of myself when I make a real meal. Not just one main dish, but a couple of sides that go together, it's fancy eating!
