Fantastic. I'm going to make endless variations of this recipe. Onions, all kinds of peppers, tomatoes, even peas or carrots might fit. The texture is more bread-like than pudding, but a lot creamier than plain old corn bread. It almost tastes cheesy, but that might just be my eyes playing tricks on me because of the color. I even got away with using frozen corn here, which made this easy recipe even simpler.

Most importantly though, the corn and coconut milk combination is just perfect. The combo is also used in the corn bisque and I think deserves to be in other corn recipes as well.

This is definitely going to be a staple.
