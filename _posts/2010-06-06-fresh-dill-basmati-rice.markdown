More chickpeas! Chickpeas and anything seems good these days. This rice dish was actually pretty good. The dill flavor was a little overwhelming but it is a great way to consume a lot of chard. (Leafy greens are so good for you, and yet so unappetizing)

I used brown rice, didn't soak it at all, and just cooked the final mixture for longer. This turned out fine. I also used a food processor to chop the chard which I think makes for an infinitely better dish. I hate the feeling of long slimy greens, and some pieces always seem to miss the knife chop. Nothing gets past the food processor!
