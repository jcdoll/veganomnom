I used to think polenta was really bland and mushy, but this turned out very well. I really like the look of the poppy seeds (I couldn't taste them much). Easy to make, very easy to add vegetable additions to.

I actually had some cheesy polenta at work the other day, which was absolutely delicious. That combined with this recipe has made me a convert. Polenta is good!
