I knew I wasn't going to like this recipe either, so I kind of cheated and only made one roll. It is pretty, but doesn't taste very good!

The filling wasn't too bad though, we just ate it by itself. Barbecue sauce and beans always makes a great combination.

The recipe was pretty easy to make, so in the future, I might try it again with modifications. Forget the wraps, probably halve the collards in the filling, and then you'd have a nice saucy dish without too much green in it.
