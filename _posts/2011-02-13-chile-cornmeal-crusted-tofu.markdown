This tofu had a fantastic texture - but absolutely no flavor. It was great as part of a sandwich, but really needs a sauce to go with it. I could see it mixing really well with barbecue sauce.

The recipe was easy to follow. There isn't any marinating, so the preparation is pretty fast. I choose the baking method for cooking the tofu this time, and it worked out very well.

My only complaint here was that the instructions called for way too much of the milk and cornmeal mixtures. I ended up wasting a lot of the coating, which just doesn't sit well with me. Next time I will definitely cut all the ingredients by at least half.
