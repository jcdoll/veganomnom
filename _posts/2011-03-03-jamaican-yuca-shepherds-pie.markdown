My pie didn't actually have any yuca in it. Yuca is another one of those hard to find vegetables that I just didn't have any luck with. So in this recipe I replaced the mashed topping with yams instead, which actually turned out really well.

The curry in this dish was delicious. Coconut milk is just one of my most favorite things - anything with coconut milk in it is guaranteed to be good. The sweet potatoes were a little hard though, they definitely needed more cooking time.

I'll make this again, but I think I will skip the topping and baking step and instead serve the whole thing over rice. With some additional cooking time for the vegetables it should make this a fantastic curry recipe.
