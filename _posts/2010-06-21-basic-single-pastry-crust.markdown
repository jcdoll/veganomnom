Easiness: 3
Tastiness: 3

Whole wheat pastry crust probably isn't a good idea... but I did it anyway. I'm fairly stubborn about making food healthy as well as tasty. Unfortunately, the lack of magical white flour definitely shows through. My version was dense and decidedly un-pastry like.

It wasn't horrible though! And I can imagine it tasting delicious with the fluffy white stuff. For me, I'll just stick to not needing pastry crusts and everything will work out fine.
