I really liked the tomato and basil in this soup. They really took the soup up a notch by giving the flavors a kick while adding some color.

I think it could have benefited from a little creaminess though. When I make this again I will probably puree all of the potatoes before adding the corn. And I might also add a little almond (or coconut!) milk to really get a nice texture.

Regardless, I'm really looking forward to summer corn so that I can make this over and over again.
