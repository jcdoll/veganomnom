This was a pretty tasty cookie, although I could definitely taste the rum. I'm usually not a big fan of frostings on cookies, but this wasn't too bad.

The dough was a little too wet for me so I ended up adding in more flour. This did make it easier to roll the nuts on.

The recipe was straight forward, but was a little painful just because of the nuts and frosting. I think the nuts are pretty crucial to this cookie, so I don't think I would skip them, but the frosting could definitely be left out.
