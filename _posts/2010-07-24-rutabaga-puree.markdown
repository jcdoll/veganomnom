I actually used turnips for this. The recipe said I could and I had them on hand, so I guess this is actually turnip puree. This is a very easy recipe with the only annoying part being the 1/4 cup of coconut milk ingredient. (I used up the rest of my can with the corn pudding)

Anyway, you cook the turnips, add the other ingredients, and puree. Joey liked it, but I thought it tasted very... turnipy... Which is probably to be expected, but I'll probably try to do something more creative with my turnips in the future.
