We ate this with the [tamarind lentils]({% post_url 2010-05-26-tamarind-lentils %}), and the combination was perfect. This rice is fairly plain, but with a little bit of salt the flavors come out pretty well.

The only hard part of the recipe is grinding all of the coriander seeds. My little pepper mill got a workout. Besides that, it's a pretty simple rice and spices dish. Instead of plain brown rice, this is a very easy way to add some quick flavor.
