This recipe is way too large! I had to use two different baking dishes just to fit the thing in the oven. And I couldn't fit the whole mixture in any of my pots, which meant that the rice didn't get quite the attention it needed and refused to cook. We had to put the pans back into the oven at a hotter temperature for an extra hour.

Once everything did cook it turned out very well. Like spanish rice, but with more to it. The seitan was a very nice touch, but making the seitan and then this big dish was a huge amount of work.

So, this was very delicious, but I might try to cut it in half somehow to make it easier.
