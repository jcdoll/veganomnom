Oh how I wish I could still eat cilantro. Alas, ever since I learned that it reminds some people of soap I've joined the anti-cilantro party and haven't been able to go back. So for me, this was like soapy tofu.

I can see how it would be good though and, minus the soap, would probably make a good basic sour cream. Neither Joey nor I really has much use for sour cream though, so its not a staple we need in our kitchen.

It was a very pretty green, but I probably won't make it again.
