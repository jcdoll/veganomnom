Well, I'm just not good at breakfast foods. I love to eat pancakes, but I should have waited for Joey to flip these. You can see my failed pancake forming in the picture.

They still tasted good though! Batter is fairly easy to make too. Usually I only have frozen blueberries, so instead of waiting for them to thaw I just sprinkle them on the pancake once it is cooking. If you mix in frozen berries into the batter itself it will just freeze into clumps and turn purple. That doesn't work very well, unless you are going for purple pancakes, which could be sorta cool.
