I want to eat this every day. It was just that good. The balance between avocado, mango, and tomato was just perfect.

I even forgot real tomatos at the store and had to use canned ones and it still turned out well. The avocado chunks make this a very filling salsa, and I even ended up eating a lot of it straight up.

Easy to make, and so healthy, this recipe is a winner.
