Easiness: 4
Tastiness: 1

This rice was boring, and not worth the expensive saffron it used. It just tasted like rice cooked in vegetable stock, or something light like that.

It wasn't hard to make, especially because I didn't go through the trouble of saving my saffron threads for reuse. That's pretty irrelevant though, because I won't be making this again.
