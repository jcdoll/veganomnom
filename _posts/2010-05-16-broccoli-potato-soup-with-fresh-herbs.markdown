Pureeing vegetables is so fun - it's like they aren't even vegetables anymore! This soup in particular hides the broccoli very well. It mostly just tastes like potatoes. I skipped the fresh herbs here, which definitely made the soup a little more bland, but I liked it.

One benefit of this recipe is that it only cooks for 30min, much faster than some of the other soups. This makes a ridiculously large amount as well. I could see halving the recipe and cheating with frozen broccoli to make this a little more manageable.
