These were delicious. And they do taste like samosas, except without any dough.

I actually had a really hard time getting the potato out of its skin, and ended up breaking a couple. Next time I think I need to bake the potatoes for even longer than an hour (or perhaps leave off the aluminum foil?)

After the potato was all mashed up though, making the rest of the stuffing was easy. Just a bunch of veggies and spices mixed together. In fact, I could just make mashed potatoes with all of the other veggies instead of waiting for the potatoes to bake. (The whole thing would then taste great inside of a tortilla - although I guess that's true for just about anything!)
