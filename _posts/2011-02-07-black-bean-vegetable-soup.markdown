This was really bland. It just tasted like very cooked black beans.

The recipe said that this would be more flavorful the next day, but unfortunately that wasn't true. In the fridge, the beans just kept soaking up more and more liquid and the whole thing got really thick. This wasn't necessarily bad, but we ended up eating the dish as a burrito filling rather than a soup.

I'm not sure exactly why the soup was so bland, maybe the bean to veggie ratio was just too high. I would probably cut the beans at least in half to try and get a better soup out of this recipe.
