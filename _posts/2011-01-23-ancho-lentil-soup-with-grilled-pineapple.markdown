This soup was alright, but not great. I definitely prefer the [french lentil]({% post_url 2010-09-10-french-lentil-soup %}) recipe.

The pineapple was kinda cool, but made for weird leftovers, because it didn't keep well in the fridge (lost its flavor and became firmer). The hot sauce was a nice garnish, but was pretty much required to give the soup flavor. It was just too bland without it.

Oh, I did change one aspect of this recipe. I wasn't able to make my own chile powder. I just couldn't find dried ancho chiles. So I substituted with normal chile powder. I don't think the homemade chile powder could have saved this dish though, although the concept is pretty cool.
