The mushrooms on the top of this soup were amazing. They had a salty tangy flavor and were really quick to make. I can see myself using them to top many soups or other dishes.

The soup itself was pretty good, although the chunks of squash had a slightly odd texture. A little firm/grainy. I'm glad half of them were pureed. It would be interesting to try pureeing the whole thing before adding in the beans.

After I finally got my acorn squash peeled and chopped, this recipe was pretty easy. That one step is killer though, and it's just so much easier to bake a squash in the oven. So I might try this soup again next winter, but I would prob just skip the chopping step and instead just mix in a whole baked squash.
