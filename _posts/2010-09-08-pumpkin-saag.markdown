This saag was good. A little bland, but it has a nice base that could probably be spiced up to make it more flavorful.

I did modify the recipe somewhat to make it easier. I used canned pumpkin instead of cooking one from scratch, and dumped in some pre-cut frozen spinach instead of fresh. This took the cooking time down drastically, which made this doable for an after-work dinner. The substituions also mean you don't have to wait for pumpkin to be in season.

I really love how healthy this dish is. Straight up vegetables - even some leafy greens. I'll definitely make it again, and maybe just add in some additional spices to make it a little more tasty.
