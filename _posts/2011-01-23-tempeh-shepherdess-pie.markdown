This was another huge recipe. I definitely should have halved it because it was really hard to fit in my pan - and in the end we were left with a whole lot of bland pie.

I've never had shepherd's pie before, so I wasn't sure what to expect here. Unfortunately, the dish started off really well but then went downhill. The initial flavor of the tempeh and veggies was great (tempeh and soy sauce is always a good combo). But then everything was diluted with the veggie broth and again with the mashed potatoes. In the end the dish was just rather bland and needed spicing up.  

So this was alright, but not stellar.
I don't think I'll make the whole thing again - although I could see cooking just the first half...
