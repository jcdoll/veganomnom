Joey says this is the best curry I've made. I didn't think it was quite _that_ good, but I did like it (especially after a day in the fridge - it seemed more flavorful.)

I hate chopping cauliflower, because it always makes such a huge mess, but besides that this recipe was easy. And the instructions lie - you don't really have to prep everything before you begin. The onions and shallots cook for long enough to chop up the chile and parsnips and whatnot.

I do think this is another excellent way to incorporate more cauliflower into my diet, so we'll probably have it again.
