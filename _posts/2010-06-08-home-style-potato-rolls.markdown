These rolls weren't bad. They weren't the best I've ever had, but that's probably because of my whole wheat flour substitution. I still haven't found the best way to make a lighter bread with whole wheat flour.

I also cheated by trying to use up some potato flakes I had in the cupboard instead of mashing potatoes by hand. This saved me a ton of time, I don't think the recipe would be worth it if I also had to make mashed potatoes from scratch.

So all in all, I'll probably make these again to use up more potato flakes but I'll nix the glaze (which wasn't worth it and is just strange).
