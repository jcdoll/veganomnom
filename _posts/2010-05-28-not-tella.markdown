Easiness: 2
Tastiness: 5

I'm so glad I don't have to miss Nutella anymore. This version tastes just as good, and doesn't have some of the weirdness of the store-bought version. (Any processed good that can stay in the cupboard without refrigeration for that long is just asking for trouble)

Roasting and blending the hazelnuts is a slight pain, but it's just as bad as making peanut butter. My little food processor got a workout, and couldn't produce a completely smooth product in the end, but it still tasted delicious.

The only really hard part is finding hazelnut extract. I haven't found any yet and I mistakenly told myself I could just substitute some almond extract. (both nuts, right?) Unfortunately, I completely forgot how strong the almond flavor is, which added quite a different taste to the first batch. It still wasn't bad though, just different.

Anyway, this chocolate hazelnut spread is just amazing, and will probably be given as future dinner party gifts!
