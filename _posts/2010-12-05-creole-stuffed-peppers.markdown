These ended up being very tasty, but I'm not sure they are worth the work.

I think the bean, tomato and other veggie saute was good enough to stand on its own - especially if you just added some chopped red peppers into the mix. The extra steps of boiling, stuffing, and baking the red peppers is something I would probably only do for company.

Next time I'll also definitely use fresh tomatoes instead of canned ones, this isn't one of those recipes which needs the canned version.
