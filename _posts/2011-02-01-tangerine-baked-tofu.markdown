Easiness: 4
Tastiness: 4

This is Joey's favorite tofu recipe. (Although it's probably tied with the [BBQ one]({% post_url 2011-01-23-baked-bbq-tofu %})) I really didn't like it that much due to its mushiness, and still think the [asian tofu]({% post_url 2011-01-23-marinated-asian-tofu %}) is currently the best combination of easiness and flavor. But to each his own!

The marinade for this one did smell good, but I thought the end result was a little tangy. The cooking process was more involved than the simpler pre-marinated versions. I had a hard time flipping the tofu repeatedly; it started to fall apart. Overall, not a bad recipe.
