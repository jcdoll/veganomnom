I don't really like brussel sprouts, so I don't have much opinion as to how these taste. Joey does though, and he thought these were pretty flavorless. Equivalent to just steaming the things. He would have preferred a sauce, or some other mechanism for enhancing their taste.

They were pretty easy to make, but I'll look for other ways to prep this gross mini cabbage in the future.
