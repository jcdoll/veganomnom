This salad was huge. It made way too much. Joey also said it was pretty bland. Filling, but not very exciting. It needs to be mixed with other things in order to give it some flavor.

It was pretty easy to make though. And bulgur is kinda cool - I like the fact that you only need to pour boiling water over the grain to cook it.  It might be useful when backpacking (just like couscous).
