I actually ate some sushi!

Unfortunately, I thought it was pretty gross. The seaweed flavor was overwhelming, and doesn't taste good to me. Joey didn't like it either, and mentioned that other sushi he has had doesn't have such a gross flavor to it. I'm not sure what's different, but I would definitely need to find out before I made something like this again.

The hard part of this recipe was mostly just assembling the rolls. It was very difficult to cut through the nori, and all of our pieces ended up a little squished. We ended up eating the insides without the nori wrapping, which was pretty good - just some rice, tempeh and avocado.
