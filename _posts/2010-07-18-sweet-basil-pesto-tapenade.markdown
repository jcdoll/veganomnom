This was fantastic! The maple syrup makes this nice and sweet, almost like a dessert. We had a picnic, and this dip went fast. Everyone loved it.

After you pick all your basil leaves off the stems this is very easy to make. Just throw everything in a food processor and blend it up. The amount was about right too. It was nice and creamy perfection.

If necessary, I think the maple could be scaled back a bit if the dip needed to be less sweet. (On a sandwich or something.)

I love pesto, and I love this even more, so I'm going to be making this recipe very often.
