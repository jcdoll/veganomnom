Plain Jane bread. Pretty gross. It looked pretty, and cut nicely, and was utterly bland. Bleh. Lola (our dog) ate most of it.

I've made other focaccia recipes, and none of them have ever required so much rising. They have also called for more salt and oil than this recipe had. Or sometimes milk, I think that gives it a better flavor. This just took forever and wasn't worth it.
