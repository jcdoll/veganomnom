This was good! I was really skeptical. A layered bread casserole? And it had so much spinach in it. But it turned out to just be a savory bread pudding. And I love bread pudding!

The tofu custard was a little funny tasting but I think that might be the fault of my mustard. I didn't have any yellow on hand and so used stoneground - which is much different. It is amazing the things tofu can do though. So far it has been an egg, ricotta cheese, cream, a thickener, a filler, and it just goes on. It can pretty much taste like anything you want. We've already gone through 3 pounds this week! Incredible.

And yes, tofu is one of those things I wouldn't have touched with a 10 foot pole before. I still won't eat it in non-blended/hidden form, but I'm sure that will change soon. There are a lot of recipes left...

Anyway, the strata was a success. Definitely a good brunch item. Its only downside is that it takes an hour to cook. As long as you are prepared for it, this is a keeper.
