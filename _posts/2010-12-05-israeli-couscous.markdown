This recipe was extremely easy, and didn't take much time besides the shelling of the pistachios. They were worth it though, the nuts and apricots went really well with the couscous. And the touch of lime juice was just the perfect amount of light flavor.

The dish is very grain heavy, so it needs to be eaten with some vegetable sides in order to balance things out. I think it would go very well with roasted asparagus.

As soon as I can get my hands on enough israeli couscous, I'll be making this recipe repeatedly.
