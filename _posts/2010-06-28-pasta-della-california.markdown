This pasta is full of green. Broccoli, arugula and avocados all mixed together with a garlic and veggie broth sauce. It isn't my favorite type of pasta. I tend to prefer pureed veggie sauces rather than big vegetable chunks getting in the way of my noodle eating. That said, it wasn't that bad, and Joey loved it.

(Oh, and my avocados were overly ripe and this dish still worked out fine, contrary to the instruction's warning)
