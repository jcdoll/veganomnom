Why are there so many crisp and cobbler recipes? I haven't found a single variation on a basic crisp that I've liked. This one tried to add coconut and combine it with different berries - which just isn't a good idea. At least it was better than rosewater...

This was simple to make, but I don't recommend it. I also don't recommend using only partially thawed blueberries. It seems to make the berries tough and unpleasant. I'll stay with the simple crisp and stop messing with the natural flavors of my fruit.
