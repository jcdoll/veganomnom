This recipe has a pretty daunting list of ingredients. After gathering things up, it wasn't too bad - but there was just a lot of chopping, mixing, watching and so forth.

I actually liked the okra in this soup. It's a pretty weird veggie, but the book was right in that frozen okra is very easy to deal with. (The fresh stuff always oozes that weird goo.)

The rest of the ingredients all went really well together (although its hard to go wrong with tomatoes, beans, and peppers.) In the end this was very good, just time consuming.
