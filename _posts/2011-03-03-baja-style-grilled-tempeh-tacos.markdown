I had been avoiding this recipe because it looked fairly complicated, but it actually wasn't that bad. There are 3 separate parts - slaw, tempeh, and lime crema - and they all get made in advance. So even though it takes some work, the final preparation is fast.

The overall result was pretty good. I liked the tempeh, and even put some of the crema on my taco. I stayed away from the slaw, but Joey liked it.

I'm not sure I would go through the effort of making these tacos again, but that's just because Joey and I are really good at making burritos from whatever leftovers are in the fridge.
