This dish was alright, but a little bland. It relied on adding a lot of salt to make it flavorful. And even though the recipe insists that you need to use dry beans, in the end this is just a white bean, mushroom, and leek dish. Nothing very fancy, canned beans would work just fine.

Which isn't to say I have anything against making beans from scratch, but I was dismayed to waste an onion, carrot, and celery stalk on their cooking. I did not notice the flavor difference in using up those vegetables as a stock, and in the future I would rather just throw them into the main dish. It would make the whole thing much more flavorful.
