Delicious! There was something about this combination of chickpeas, quinoa, and coriander that was just perfect. It was extremely flavorful - just the right amount of saltiness and spice. The idea of mixing a can of beans into a grain is pretty new to me, but I really like the texture variation it created. Everything about this recipe was just spot on.
