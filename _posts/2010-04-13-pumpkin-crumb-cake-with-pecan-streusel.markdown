I've made this recipe many times. It's one of my favorites (second to modified apple cake). Easy to make if you have a can of pumpkin, and a nice blend between salty and sweet. I think it goes perfectly with coffee.

The one change I make is to use a lot more nuts for the topping. And I'm fairly lazy, so I don't chop the nuts like I should. I just use the halves straight up.
