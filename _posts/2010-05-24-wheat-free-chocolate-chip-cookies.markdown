Well that was a little bit of a failure. And too bad too, the cookies taste delicious... but they are as flat as a pancake. The dough looked pretty oily in the mixing bowl - so I'm guessing I didn't make enough oat flour and had too much oil in this batch.

Now at least I know what to watch out for. Next time I'll be sure to double check my oat flour measurements. At least I won't mind having to experiment with this one!
