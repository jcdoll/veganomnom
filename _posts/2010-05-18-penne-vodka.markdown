This doesn't exactly taste like typical penne vodka, but it was still pretty good. The only weird part was the texture. Blending the almonds inside the sauce was very messy, and didn't work very well. The end result was fairly grainy. I think it might be better with cashews instead for a nice creamy sauce. The blending did remove the wateriness problem that the [mariana recipe]({% post_url 2010-05-08-marinara-sauce %}) has though. All the tomatoes were thoroughly crushed which thickened things up quite nicely.

The bite of the vodka kept this from being bland, and it got better after sitting in the fridge for a while too. I'd make it again if I could figure out how to keep the sauce from splashing so much with the immersion blender.
