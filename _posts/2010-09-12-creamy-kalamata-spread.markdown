This was a weird spread. It seemed kind of mayonnaisey, and I really don't like mayonnaise. It was simple enough to make, but I think it ruined some of the olive flavor. I would have preferred more of an olive paste.

I might try something like this again while leaving out all of the tofu. That would concentrate the olive flavors while getting rid of the creamy grossness and should make for a much better spread.
