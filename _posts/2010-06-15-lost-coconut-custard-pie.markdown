I haven't had many custard pies in my life, so I can say with confidence that this is the best one I've ever had. It uses two thickeners which I don't have much experience with - arrowroot powder and agar flakes - to magically gel up into a fairly perfect consistency. And the coconut flavor is light with a perfect touch of vanilla and lemon.

Because of the thickener newness though, this recipe was a little tricky. I was unsure if I had let the custard concoction cook long enough on the stove, especially because the agar didn't seem to dissolve all the way. It turned out all right though, the real key was letting it cool long enough. The longer it sat in the fridge, the better the texture got. Needless to say, the whole pie was gone pretty quickly.
