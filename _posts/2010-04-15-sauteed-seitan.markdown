If you had some seitan ready to go this recipe would be very easy to make. You essentially just throw the seitan with some veggies in a pan, cook, and eat. Easy as pie... but not very tasty. The texture was great because each ingredient sort of has its own feel. The mushrooms and seitan are an especially good combo.

I thought the flavor was lacking though. A light sauce would probably improve things. We had ours over pasta and the whole thing was very dry. Next time I would probably add a can of fire roasted tomatoes at the end, and serve with nutritional yeast cheese.
